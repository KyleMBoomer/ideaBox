# Idea Box Group Project

## Table of Contents

### Introduction
This project allows users to create their own ideas, save them, and make a preferred (or "favorited") state for each of them.  
Idea Box was built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to provide user functionality and a sleek interface. Users may never forget their best ideas again!

### Features
Users may interact with multiple buttons on the app. They can save ideas, favorite them, and toggle between just their favorite ideas and the entirety of their  
saved ideas library. They also may un-favorite any idea at any time, and if there is a duplicate idea, there is user-error functionality to prevent that as well. 

### Installation 
Visit this [repo](https://github.com/sanghoro/ideaBox-groupProject) to access the repo on github.
Fork and clone down the repo to your machine, and open the index.html file to save all your best ideas.
